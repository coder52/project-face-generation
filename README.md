# Face Generation

In this project, I will define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, I'll visualize the results of my trained Generator to see how it performs; my generated samples are look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

### Get the Data

I'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the adversarial networks.

I will define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested that utilize a GPU for training.
